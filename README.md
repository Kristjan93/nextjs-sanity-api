# Blog website made with nextjs and sanity-cms
Wanted to try out this combo and see what all the fuss was about.
Its nice but this GROQ that sanity uses for queries is sus.
Makes me wonder if the graphql support that sanity offers is better.
That approach can be found TODO:TODO

## Notable techno jargon
- Typescript is fully supported with the help of [sanity-codegen](https://www.sanity.io/plugins/sanity-codegen) that some nerd made.
But as i said its kinda crap how you fetch references like post -> author.



Not that informative readme but its alright as a speck of dust in the universe this is of little conscience"
